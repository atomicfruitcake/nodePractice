# Node Practice
Decided to learn nodejs so I'm recording my work here an creating an example node application for myself to use as reference.

# How to use?
To install node packages, run
```bash
npm install
```

To start, use 
```bash
node server.js
```
The application will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
